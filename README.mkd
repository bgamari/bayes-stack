# bayes-stack: Parallel MCMC inference on graphical models

`Bayes-stack` is a framework for parallel probabilistic inference on
graphical models.  The framework provides infrastructure for easily
implementing MCMC/Gibbs sampling methods capable of scaling to dozens
of cores.

Along with the framework itself, several models using blocked Gibbs
sampling are provided in `topic-models/`.
