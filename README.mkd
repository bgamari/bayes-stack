# BayesStack: A Bayesian inference framework

BayesStack is a framework for building, learning, and inferring from
probabilistic graphical models. Learning is implemented by a
traditional Gibbs sampler, designed to scale to up to dozens of cores.

Along with the framework itself, several example models are given in
`topic-models`.
