# Network topic models for `bayes-stack`

`network-topic-models` implements a few network topic models on top of
`bayes-stack`. These include,

  * LDA [1]
  * Shared taste model [2]
  * Citation influence model [3]
  
We adopt the following nomenclature,

  * Node: a document or user that contains items
  * Item: a word, tag, or other content of a node
  * Edge: a set of two nodes (undirected edge)
  * Arc:  a pair of two nodes (directed edge)

See `doc/models/models.tex` for graphical representation of the
implemented models.
